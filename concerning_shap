Where we can find the code that led to the choices of the two SHAP hyperparameters:

First SHAP hyperparameter (required size of the random subset of the training data necessary for convergence of the average NN prediction):
- q2_column_based_qubicc_r2b5/source_code/shap_how_many_samples_to_infer_expected_value.ipynb

--> 10^4 corresponds to a value of 5 on the x-axes and is our choice for the hyperparameter

Second SHAP hyperparameter (required size of the random subset of the test data so that we can generate robust plots of averaged absolute SHAP values)
- additional_content/shap_additional_files/sensitivity_to_background.ipynb
- Average absolute SHAP values per subset size: /additional_content/shap_values/averaged_shap_values
