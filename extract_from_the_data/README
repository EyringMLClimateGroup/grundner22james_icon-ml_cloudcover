- To an R2B4 and an R2B5 grid coarse-grained data from the NARVAL (Klocke et al., 2017: 'Rediscovery of the doldrums in storm-resolving simulations over the tropical Atlantic') 
  and the QUBICC hindcast simulations hc2, hc3, hc4 (Giorgetta et al., 2022: 'The ICON-A model for direct QBO simulations on GPUs')
- The dataset contains one timestep per day of cloud volume fraction data and one timestep with all variables
- fr_lake: Fraction of lakes (2D), fr_land: Fraction of land (2D), pres/pfull: Pressure [Pa], qc/clw: Specific cloud water content [kg/kg], 
  qi/cli: Specific cloud ice content [kg/kg], qv/hus: Specific humidity [kg/kg], rho: Air density [kg/m^3], temp/ta: Air temperature [K], u/ua: Zonal wind [m/s], 
  v/va: Meridional wind [m/s], zg: Geometric height at full levels [m], zghalf: Geometric height at half levels [m], clc/cl: Cloud volume fraction [%],
  cl_area: Cloud area fraction [%]

- There is a temporal mismatch between some model output variables from one common time step. This is caused by the sequential processing of some parameterization schemes in the ICON model. 
  For instance, the cloud cover scheme diagnoses cloud cover before the microphysics scheme alters the cloud condensate mixing ratio, which has led to $\approx$\,7\% of the cloudy grid cells in our data to be condensate-free. 
  However, this mismatch should not exceed the fast physics time step in the model, which was set to 40 seconds in the QUBICC and to five minutes in the NARVAL simulations.
- The mixing length in the vertical diffusion scheme was mistakenly set to 1000m instead of 150m, causing unrealistically strong vertical diffusion in some situations.
